        <p>
            Theme Bootswatch is a Bootstrap child theme for Moodle 2.7 and newer,
            This theme uses the bootswatches created by Thomas Park, see <a href="http://bootswatch.com/">Bootswatch.com</a>.
            A Bootswatch is nothing more then a set of variables for sizes, fonts and colours that are combined into your
            theme css file.
